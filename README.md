## About The Client

JitsMob aims to educate the Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ) and Mixed Martial Arts (MMA) community through online content on topics such as: 
 * Injury prevention 
 * Mobility 
 * Show types of exercises people can do to maximise performance and complement what people do in class 

It currently has a social media presence on Instagram (@JitsMob), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCe6FjCO70FkCIqaGkPEyXZQ), and [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/JitsMob-1854775828114449/). They have requested they would like a dedicated website to assist in increasing social media following and eventually generate revenue from online content from this website.


The client project has been split into two phases, with the development team focusing on delivering phase one.
 * Phase One: Increase online presence and followers with the assistance of a website for the company
 * Phase Two: Generate revenue from online purchases/subscriptions of content
